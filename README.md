# Track-diabetes


### **Track-diabetes Using Machine Learning**

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict and diagnose diabetes based on various patient health metrics. By analyzing key features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, glucose levels, and family history, the model classifies individuals into two categories: **diabetic** or **non-diabetic**.

#### **Key Features:**

* **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, normalizing data, and encoding categorical features.
* **Feature Selection:** Identifying the most relevant features to improve prediction accuracy and model efficiency.
* **Model Training:** Using various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) to train and test the model.
* **Evaluation:** Utilizing performance metrics such as accuracy score
* **Real-Time Predictions:** Implementing the trained model for real-time diabetes prediction, enabling early detection and intervention.

This project aims to provide a tool for healthcare professionals and individuals to predict the risk of diabetes based on their health data, ultimately contributing to **early diagnosis** and **better management** of diabetes.

#### **Technologies Used:**

* **Python** (for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation)
* **Pandas & NumPy** (for data manipulation)
* **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning models and metrics)
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)
* **Jupyter Notebooks** (for interactive data exploration)

#### **Project Goals:**

* Assist in early detection of diabetes.
* Help healthcare providers make data-driven decisions.
* Improve the accuracy and efficiency of traditional diagnostic methods.
